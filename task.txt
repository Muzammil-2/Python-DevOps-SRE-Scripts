#class python script example for DevOps Engineer in real time scenario

# Here's a Python script that automates the deployment of an application using AWS and Docker, 
  a common real-time scenario for a DevOps Engineer.

# A DevOps Engineer needs to deploy a containerized application to an AWS EC2 instance, ensuring 
  the latest version is always pulled from a container registry (DockerHub or ECR).

# Features of the Script:
1. Connects to an AWS EC2 instance using SSH.

2. Pulls the latest Docker image from a registry.

3. Stops and removes any existing container.

4. Runs the new container with the updated image.


# Python Script (deploy_app.py)
  Ensure you have paramiko installed (pip install paramiko).

# How This Works:
1. SSH into EC2: Uses Paramiko to securely connect to the AWS instance.

2. Pull Latest Image: Ensures the latest version of the app is deployed.

3. Stop & Remove Old Container: Avoids conflicts with the previous deployment.

4. Run the New Container: Starts the updated version of the app on port 80.


# Prerequisites:
1. An AWS EC2 instance with Docker installed.

2. A private key (.pem) for SSH authentication.

3. The Docker image pushed to DockerHub or AWS ECR.

4. Python installed with paramiko.

# This script can be extended to use AWS Systems Manager (SSM) for more secure access. ðŸš€
